The agent.py is the heart part of the project.  
It is located on smartcab folder and should be run separately before other parts,
to create the files (CSV, TXT,...) which visuals.py uses to create the charts. 

Two log folders need to be created one in the smartcab folder directory and the other one in the parent directory
(one folder up to smartcab folder.

The agent.py creates the nessecary files in the log folder in the smartcab folder. 
These files should be copied to the log folder of the parent directory before running visuals.py.
